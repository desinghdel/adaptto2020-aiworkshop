## Building Data Science Reports using AEM data and Jupyter Notebook

**Description**: This part of the workshop's objective is to get familiar with AEMpy and Jupyter. We use a Docker image, so you don't have to install Python, Jupyter, AEM, and all the necessary libraries.

We will connect to an AEM instance using AEMpy, and analyze the error.log file with a popular Data Science Python library: pandas.
Then we will visualize the data and see how to detect anomaly to predict an AEM instance crash.

**Please make sure you have been through the prerequisites before running the code.**

**For the prerequisites, see file [0.Prerequisites.md](./0.Prerequisites.md).**

### Open Jupyter

Open your browser and launch the Jupyter UI: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

You have access to two notebooks:
- **Logs_Basics.ipynb** : This notebook contains the code from the previous Python exercise
- **Logs_Instance_Crash_Prediction.ipynb** : This notebook contains the code for the current exercise

### Open the Notebook

Open the notebook `Logs_Instance_Crash_Prediction` by clicking on it from the Jupyter UI.

From here, a new window opens and with all the code included for the second part.

### Run a cell

Depending on your system, you can execute a cell using the command: `Shift + Enter`

> âš  *Note: Other commands exist to execute a cell, but `Shift+Enter` execute a command and move the cursor to the next cell*

We will go through each cell one by one as some explanations are necessary with the code.
